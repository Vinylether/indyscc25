# SST-Elements for IndySCC and SCC at SC25

Update: For the SST **code**, please use the upstream repos:
- <https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-core>
- <https://github.com/sstsimulator/sst-elements>

Per Patrick's message in the Google group "For now you should pull from the devel branch 
for both core and elements on the sstsimulator GitHub page".

This repo has the [instructions](IndySCC_Problems.pdf) and supporting scripts etc.

Use the "Issues" tab in this repo to ask questions, and to browse already-asked questions.
